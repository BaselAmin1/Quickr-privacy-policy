Quickr Privacy Policy

At Quickr, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. As the creators of the NFC card social media and info-sharing platform, we want to provide you with full transparency regarding how your data is handled. This Privacy Policy outlines the data we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect your privacy.

By using Quickr, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. Please read it carefully to understand how we protect and handle your data.

1. Data Collection & Use

Quickr allows users to create and share NFC cards, which may contain information such as contact details, social media profiles, or personal data. We store this information using Firebase by Google. Please note that any information uploaded to Quickr is considered public as the links to these NFC cards can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate link.

We do not actively collect or monitor your personal data outside of what you upload through the NFC cards. Any data you share via the NFC card is solely your responsibility, and we do not store or track this information beyond what is necessary for the functionality of the service.

2. Data Storage & Access

Quickr stores the data you upload (such as contact information, social media profiles, or other content) on Firebase, which is a cloud storage service provided by Google. This data is stored securely, but since the links to NFC cards are public, the information may be accessed by anyone with the link.

While we do our best to ensure security, you should assume that any information shared through your NFC card may be publicly accessible.

3. Cookies & Tracking Technologies

Quickr does not use cookies or tracking technologies to monitor your activity or collect personal information. We do not track your device or gather analytics regarding your use of the app.

4. Third-Party Websites & Links

Our platform may include links to third-party websites for your convenience. These external websites have their own privacy policies, and Quickr is not responsible for their practices. We encourage you to review their privacy policies when visiting third-party websites.

5. Data Security

We take your security seriously and implement industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your information while it is stored on Firebase. However, please note that since the links to your NFC cards are publicly accessible, we cannot guarantee complete protection against unauthorized access to the data you share via the NFC card links.

6. Children's Privacy

Quickr is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, we will promptly delete it.

If you are under 13, please do not use Quickr.


7. Lifetime of Product & Renewal

The "lifetime of product" refers to the duration of access to the Quickr service and the NFC card links associated with your account. The lifetime of the product is defined as one (1) year from the date of purchase or activation of the service. At the end of the 1-year period, your access to the service and associated NFC cards will be subject to renewal, free of charge.

You will be notified prior to the end of the year. Your NFC card links and any associated data may no longer be accessible after the decided period expires, your card will still be physically valid.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated to you via the app or other appropriate channels. We encourage you to regularly review this policy to stay informed about how we handle your data.
